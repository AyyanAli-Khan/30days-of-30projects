# Day 1 - Simple Counter Application 🕒

Welcome to Day 1 of the **30 Days of 30 Projects** challenge! 🎉 Today, we kickstarted the journey by building a **Simple Counter Application** using **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn-ui, and TypeScript**. 

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application allows users to input a time (in seconds) and then manage a countdown using **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset** controls. It’s a foundational project that emphasizes interactivity, state management, and UI design.

### Key Features

- **Input Field**: Enter the countdown time in seconds.
- **Start Button**: Begin the countdown.
- **Stop Button**: Pause the countdown at any point.
- **Reset Button**: Reset the counter back to the originally set time.

This project leverages modern web technologies to deliver a smooth and responsive user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The powerful React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development.
- **Shadcn-ui**: A modern UI component library for clean and responsive design.
- **TypeScript**: For ensuring type safety and robust code quality.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```bash
.
├── components
│   └── Counter.tsx  # Main counter component
├── pages
│   └── index.tsx    # Home page where the counter is rendered
├── styles
│   └── globals.css  # Global styles with TailwindCSS configuration
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico  # Favicon for the app
└── ...
```

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-counter-nextjs.git
   cd simple-counter-nextjs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.


## 🎯 Challenges & Learnings

This project was a great way to get hands-on with **state management and hooks** in React through **Next.js**. It also provided an opportunity to practice styling with **Tailwind CSS** and explore the flexibility of **Shadcn-ui** components.

## 🌟 What's Next?

This is just the beginning! Over the next 29 days, I'll be building more exciting projects, each showcasing different aspects of **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and modern UI design.
